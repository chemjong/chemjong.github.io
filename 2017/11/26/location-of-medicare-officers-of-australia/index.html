<h2>About</h2>
<p>Goal: Learn R language just like any foreign languages 😄</p>
<p>About the data: FuelCheck ⛽provides real-time information about fuel prices at service stations across NSW. The dataset contains fuel price and other attributes for October 2017 only.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/a97a46fc-2bdd-4b90-ac7f-0cb1e8d7ac3b">FuelCheck</a> enables NSW motorists to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Find the cheapest fuel being sold anywhere in NSW</p></li>
<li><p>Get directions to any service station in NSW</p></li>
<li><p>Search for fuel by type (E10, Regular, LPG, etc) or brand</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a complaint to NSW Fair Trading if the price at the pump doesn’t match what is shown on FuelCheck.</p></li>

## Data types

Below is the summary of each variable and its class assigned to it. We can clearly see that PriceUpdatedDate is in character class. We will assign correct class to each variables.

```r
summary(data1)
```

```

### Counting unique value in each variable


```r
counts <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 8))
names(counts) <- names(data1)


for(i in seq_along(data1)){
  counts[[i]] <- length(unique(data1[[i]]))
}

kable(counts, caption = "Count of unique values")
```



Table: (\#tab:unnamed-chunk-6)Count of unique values

 ServiceStationName   Address   Suburb   Postcode   Brand   FuelCode   PriceUpdatedDate   Price
-------------------  --------  -------  ---------  ------  ---------  -----------------  ------
               1794      1926     1058        473      20          9              11965     613

This should help us in assigning correct class to each variable. Brand,FuelCode and PostCode should be changed to factors. PriceUpdatedDate as Date and Time.

### Assign new class to variables

We'll create a new variable Day_time which will convert the PriceUpdatedDate variable to date and time. This will also preserve the original data.


```r
data1 <- data1 %>% mutate_at(vars(Brand,FuelCode,Postcode), funs(as.factor(.)))</p>
<p>data1<span class="math inline">\(Day_time &lt;- dmy_hm(data1\)</span>PriceUpdatedDate) ```</p>

<h3>Density Plot</h3>
<p>Density plot shows distribution of data over a continious interval. Since they are not affected by the number of bins as in Histogram, it is better at determining the distribution shape.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data1 %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(Price_std))+

  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(data1$Price_std, na.rm = T)), linetype = &quot;longdash&quot; , size = .80)+

<p><img src="/post/2017-11-26-location-of-medicare-officers-of-australia_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Just by gleening on the density plot we can see the distribution is skewed to the left which tells us that the mean price falls on the left side of the medain price. It is also multimodal distribition which means it has multiple peaks. This is due to different types of fuel have various prices. Above density plot shows when considering all fuel types most of the fuel prices are concentrated around $1.35.</p>

<p>Descriptions for fuel code were generated from google search. However, I couldn’t find PDL information. My guess is that it stands for Premium Diesel. So I plotted density plot of PDL and DL to check for similarity. The distribution has medium similarity. I therefore think PDL is Premium Diesel.</p>

<p>Also, fuel type Compressed natural gas (CNG) is the odd one. It only has one row of data. Therefore, I’ll exclude from any plot generated below.</p>

<p>Above plot claims that Premium unleaded fuel are more expensive then the rest. They also have multimodal distribution. We can also observe that there a pattern - P98,P95 are closely grouped and E10, E85 are closely grouped.</p>

<p>I’d like to plot all boxplot in one graph so that I can use the same scale to obtain information. We can see that premium unleaded median price are the highest among all other fuel types. However they are also skewed to the left meaning there were few days the price got low but most of the time it stayed around its median price. LPG is the second cheapest fuel however, they have lot of outliers.</p>
<p>The fuel I normally use is E10. Atleast 75% of all the price for Oct were above $1.20</p>
